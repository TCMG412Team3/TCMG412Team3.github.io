  <div class="post-content">
    <p>On February 5th, 2021, Texas A&M University announced the selection of a new mascot, Reveille X.  Reveille X is currently a small 18 month old puppy who will be spending the current Spring 2021 semester shadowing Reveille IX for training. Reveille IX will formally step down as the current mascot of Texas A&M University in May after 6 years in the position. According to Brigadier General Joe E. Ramirez Jr., Commandant of the Corps of Cadets, the process of searching and selecting the next mascot of Texas A&M has lasted over a year and a half.</p>

      <p>Reveille has been the official mascot of Texas A&M University since 1931. Although the first Reveille was a mixed breed dog, Reveille has traditionally been a pure bred collie since Reveille III. Each year, Reveille is assigned a new handler, a sophomore cadet in Company E-2. Reveille lives with this handler, attends class with them, and even travels home with them for the holidays. Formally known as the First Lady of Aggieland, Reveille is also the highest ranking member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets.</p>
