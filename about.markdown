We are Team 3 from the TCMG 412 class at Texas A&M University. We are looking forward to learning more about devops from our professor Adam Mikeal and we hope to be able to share some neat projects along the way.

We think that devops is super interesting to learn about because because there is so much to learn. So hopefully we will be able to get a nice slice into the world of devops and everything that supports it.
